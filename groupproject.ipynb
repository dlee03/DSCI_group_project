    "   Pokemon is an entertainment franchise created by Nintendo that surrounds a make-believe world where people catch, train and battle creatures known as Pokemon (Pokemon, 2015). The Nintendo company continues to expand the world of Pokemon, creating new regions and Pokemon for eager fans to discover, train and battle.\n",
    "    The Pokemon are created with various statistics, appearances and personalities. In the games, which our data set and analysis are focused on, we as the player create teams of Pokemon and travel across various regions to battle other trainers and wild Pokemon (Padilla, 2003). All Pokemon have set statistics determining how powerful they are, with the highly desirable and exclusive  “Legendary Pokemon” that tend to have much higher statistics than most of the non-legendaries. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   Our predictive question is to determine whether a hypothetical Pokemon we create with random statistics is considered legendary. We will analyse different statistics of all the Pokemon up to the sixth generation, the Pokemon X and Y games, to determine what constitutes a legendary. Using our findings we will be able to create a model where we can create a new Pokemon and determine whether it would be considered a legendary or not.\n"

    "Here we tested our model by inputting a hypothetical pokemon with total_stats of 523 and produced FALSE. This is expected as on our 'pokemon prediction box plot' (Figure 3) this Pokemon would lie within the range of the non-legendary Pokemon, classifying it as non-legendary. This indicates our analysis agreed with what we expected to see, and our predictive model was able to successively predict our Pokemon. "

    "This analysis was expected to demonstrate that our Pokemon is classified as legendary if its attack, defense, special defense, hp, and speed variables lie within the range of other legendary Pokemon, and a non-legendary Pokemon if they lie below it. After analyzing our data, we determined that our predictive model works as we expected. First, we made a 75% training model using all the chosen variables of the Pokemon and then used a 25% testing data set to determine our models accuracy. Using this, we noticed that the a k-nearest neighbor value of 9 provided the best accuracy of 97%. This accuracy demonstrated the data was sufficient to use in predicting our Pokemon. We converted “Legendary” into a factor in order to use statistical functions of the column. We visualized our findings in a box plot, noticing that significant differences in variable values between legendary (blue) and non-legendary (red) Pokemon exist, with values significantly larger for legendary Pokemon compared to non-legendary Pokemon. By creating this plot, in theory, we could plot any Pokemon to determine whether it is legendary or not. \n",

    "Though our predictive model was able to predict the legendary status of our Pokemon in theory, these results may demonstrate no impact as legendary Pokemon can only be deemed legendary by the game developers themselves and there is no perfect way to determine them otherwise. However, our findings can be used by these game developers in using the general statistics found to create legendary and non-legendary Pokemon, as well as used by game players to analyze the strength and value of their own Pokemon based on its own statistics. In the development of new Pokemon, this analysis leads to the future question of what the threshold of the different attack, special attack, defense, special defense, HP, and speed variables game developers can set for a legendary Pokemon in order to ensure fairness of play between others in the future.\n",
